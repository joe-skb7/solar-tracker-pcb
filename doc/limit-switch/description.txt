------------------

Pros:
 1. Easier to implement
 2. Limit switches can be low power rated

Cons:
 1. Transistor bases are floating in the air, when limit switch is activated;
    at least bases need to be pulled down
 2. Not robust scheme: if transistor is broken, limit switch won't work


limit-switch-2.png
------------------

Pros:
 1. Robust scheme; limit switches are in motor circuit, so they will always
    work (even if transistors are broken)
 2. No need to pull-down transistors' bases

Cons:
 1. Limit switches must be high-power rated (big current); also possible
    arcing/sparking on switching should be taken into the account
 2. May be harder to implement, but may be not:
    a) in case when diodes are soldered in the board, it's getting bigger
    b) but in case when diodes are external (can be soldered on limit switches
       for example), the schematic doesn't change at all: we are just connecting
       the motor to the board not directly, but via limit switches.
