------------------

Pros:
 1. Easier to implement
 2. Limit switches can be low power rated

Cons:
 1. Transistor bases are floating in the air, when limit switch is activated;
    at least bases need to be pulled down
 2. Not a robust scheme: if transistor is broken, limit switch won't work

------------------

NOTE: flyback diodes are placed right next to motor, as they are for protecting
      the rest of the scheme from motor's back EMF. This way we can choose
      limit switches diodes for smaller voltage.

Pros:
 1. Robust scheme; limit switches are in motor circuit, so they will always
    work (even if transistors are broken)
 2. No need to pull-down transistors' bases

Cons:
 1. Limit switches must be high-power rated (big current)
 2. Additional two diodes are needed


We choose "limit-switch-2.png" option, as it's more robust and commonly adopted.
