# Solar tracker PCB

This project contains solar tracker PCB I made for my dad's project.

I used KiCAD 4.0.7 for this PCB, but it should open fine in different versions,
as I keep `-cache.lib` file in this repo.

Original schematic can be found in `doc/scheme.jpg`. Things that I changed:
* properly terminated unused OPAMP parts
* added limit switches connection

## Schematic explanation

LDR1 and LDR2 photo-resistors yield signal which is used to determine in which
direction PV unit (solar panel) should be rotated, i.e. in which direction
we have more light radiation.

Signal from photo-resistors is being compared further by comparators built on
U1A and U1B OPAMPs. Reference voltage level is generated by dividers built on
R1, R2 resistors and RV1, RV2 trim-pots.

RV1 trim-pot is used to adjust this reference voltage point, so that motor
stands still when both photo-resistors are receiving the same light level.
RV2 is used to setup hysteresis level, so that motor is not moving when the
light difference on photo-resistors is small.

H-bridge formed by Q1-Q4 transistors is powering the motor, according to control
signals from comparators. Transistors are working in switch mode, as comparators
yield only 0 or VCC:

    V_out = 0,   if V+ < V-
    V_out = Vcc, if V+ > V-

D1-D4 are just flyback diodes, providing the path for back EMF discharge from
motor's coil, preventing other elements from it (transistors can be burnt, or
limit switches can be carbonized due to arcing).

C1 provides some of the energy required by the motor during the initial spike of
each turn-on.

R3, R4 and C2 are used to properly terminate unused OPAMPs (U1C, U1D).

J5 and J6 terminal blocks (along with D5, D6 diodes) are used for connecting the
limit switches.

### Power consideration

Power voltage: 9V must be used. It's because the motor will receive only
`Vcc - 2.6` Volts, due to voltage drop across transistors and also on OPAMP,
as it's not Rail-to-Rail one. MG995 requires the voltage to be 4.8V ... 7.2V,
so the voltage drop must be accounted for.

Power current: 2A or more. Because MG995 can consume up to 1.5A on start
("stall current").

In case when 12V battery is used (it's common in solar panels appliance),
I suggest one to use external 12V-to-9V buck converter (2A rated, or more). It's
efficient (95%), small enough, and usually costs only $2-$3. No need to
over-complicate tracker schematic by adding voltage regulator scheme to it.

### Limit switches

`doc/limit-switch/` directory contains two possible schemes to implement limit
switches in H-bridge, with pros/cons overview. I personally like the second
scheme the best, so I implemented it in this project.

### EMI note

Notice that switching of DC motor's brushes leads to EMI, which may affect your
external circuits (especially digital ones, like MCUs). In that case you should
install EMI suppressor on your motor leads.

## Prepared files

`out/` directory contains ready to use files for manufacturing the PCB.

### Toner Transfer Method

See `out/toner-transfer-method/` for ready to use files.

Notes:
1. Remove the copper pour from both sides of PCB
2. Notice the Vias and front layer tracks. You need to solder jumper wires
   instead of them, in case if you are using single sided copper clad board.

### Manufacturing at plant

You can order the PCB to be manufactured on plant, e.g. at Seeed Studio (Fusion
PCB) or JLCPCB. Gerber files and drill file are prepared at `out/gerber/`.
